# PopularMovies

Accessing API- TMDb API

It shows Most popular and MOst Rated movies after fetching using Http Connection.

I have used multiple core basic tech like, Constraint Layout, Picasso API, Recycler View API, Async Task, Loaders etc.

It check Network Connection Connectivity using Broadcast Receivers.

If Network Connection is not available, It fetched the required favourite apps from the database.

I used Content Provider for fetching and storing the data in the SQLite database.
